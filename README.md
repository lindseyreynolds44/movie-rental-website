# Team â€” PLEASE READ FIRST

Be sure to run `npm i` before starting work to install all dependencies

## Working on project locally instructions:

- Create a `.env` file at the same level as app.js file
- Add the following variables:

```
PORT=8080
IP="127.0.0.1"
API_KEY="add your api key here"
HOST="add your host here"
DB_USER="add your db user here"
DB_PASS="add your db password here"
DB_NAME="add your db name here"
```

- Save the file
- Run using nodemon you should see the api key print out in the console. I added console.log for diagnostic purposes

## Working on project using cloud 9

- Create a `.env` file at the same level as app.js file
- Add the following variable:

```
API_KEY="add your api key here"
HOST="add your host here"
DB_USER="add your db user here"
DB_PASS="add your db password here"
DB_NAME="add your db name here"
```

- Save the file
- You may need to update the version of node running on Cloud 9 to get everything working correctly
- Run these commands in the terminal

```
$ nvm install node
$ npm i -g nodemon
```

- Run using nodemon you should see the api key print out in the console. I added console.log for diagnostic purposes

## Additional Config

Note: I added some config to the `package.json` file to monitor the **root** and **controllers** directories.

```
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "delay": 1000,
    "watch": [
      "./",
      "controllers/"
    ]
  },
```

All you need to do is run `nodemon` to take adantage of this.
Test it out by making a change to the `homeController.js` and saving it. Then to `app.js` and save it.
If the server restarts each time then great! Otherwise try using `nodemon -L`.
